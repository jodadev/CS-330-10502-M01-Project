## CS-330 Final Project Reflection

### How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design by identifying system components and defining how they interact before implementation. For this project, I considered scene structure, object placement, lighting strategy, and material behavior early to ensure visual clarity and technical consistency. I also evaluated potential redundancies and structured the scene in a modular way to keep the system organized and scalable.

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project strengthened my spatial reasoning and my ability to design lighting intentionally. I developed a clearer understanding of how light positioning, material properties, and shading models influence depth, mood, and readability in a 3D environment.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed an iterative process. I began with basic geometry and lighting, then incrementally refined materials, introduced multiple light sources, and adjusted shader parameters. Each step improved realism while maintaining performance stability.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
This structured, incremental approach can be applied to future engine development, embedded systems, and large-scale software projects by breaking systems into components, testing progressively, and refining intentionally.

### How do I approach developing programs?
I prioritize building stable foundations before adding complexity. In this project, I ensured transformations, camera setup, and baseline lighting were correct before expanding into multi-light configurations and material adjustments.

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I implemented shader-based lighting using the Phong model with ambient, diffuse, and specular components. I used multiple light sources to improve scene readability and selectively applied specular highlights to differentiate reflective and matte surfaces.

### How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was central. Lighting placement, material tuning, and object positioning required repeated refinement, and each milestone built on the previous one to improve both visual quality and correctness.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
My approach evolved from surface-level visual adjustments to intentional manipulation of lighting equations and shader parameters, based on a stronger understanding of how the rendering pipeline affects final output.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science provides the mathematical and systems-level foundation needed to design and optimize complex graphical and embedded systems.. in which is my career goal to provide simulations under limited resources.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
This project strengthened my understanding of linear algebra, transformations, and real-time rendering systems, supporting further study in graphics, systems programming, and performance optimization. My plan is to pursue a Phd in Computational Science so this class helped developing further skills.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
The knowledge gained supports the continued scaling of my stable game engine, Lucid Engine, and the development of a streamlined version optimized for microcontroller-based hardware in my custom gaming console project. Applying rendering principles in both high-performance and resource-constrained environments improves my ability to design efficient and scalable graphical systems.
